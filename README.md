Hi! I'm David, or Junior (depends on if you know my dad as well). 

I'm currently a senior helpdesk technician that specializes in PowerShell automation, but I'm interested in growing that knowledge into more devops/devnet style work.
I'm currently learning Javascript(nodejs) and have dabbled in python, c#, c++, and java. Powershell is my strongest area, though. I'm also learning how git/github works, 
so my repository structure may go through several changes as I figure things out.

If you're interested in getting in touch with me, please reach out at daveinjr@gmail.com. 


Thank you!
