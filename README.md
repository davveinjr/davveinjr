Hi! I'm David, or Junior (depends on if you know my dad as well). 

I've recently been hired as a Software Development engineer, with a focus in data processing using R, Python, and SQL. While this account is my personal one, a lot of my personal projects are now going to be using a lot of the same technologies that I'm using at work so I can ensure I'm properly prepared to utilize them on a daily basis. My personal projects will, for the most part, be small applications that I've always wish I could have had for my different hobbies (TTRPG's, Speedsolving Rubik's Cubes, and a few others). 

If you're interested in getting in touch with me, please reach out at daveinjr@gmail.com. 


Thank you!
